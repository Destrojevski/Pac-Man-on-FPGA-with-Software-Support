# Pac-Man-on-FPGA-with-Software-Support
VGA-based interactive object control system closely resembling the "Pac-Man" game for FPGA platform. Software support included.
The project is an implementation of a real-time interactive system on the Zybo FPGA platform. A user-controlled object (square) moves across the screen using button inputs from the FPGA, avoiding obstacles (rectangles) and collecting points (circles). The system includes custom hardware logic for VGA display control alongside software support for user-controlled square ("Pac-Man") color configuration (by reading input from switches on FPGA), input handling, collision detection and object movement, as well as a diode-based counter indicating the number of the points collected. The design was developed in Xilinx Vivado IP Integrator, utilizing the Xilinx Zynq-7000 Processing System, BRAM, AXI Timer, GPIO and custom VGA controller. Software components were implemented in Xilinx Vitis, enabling real-time interaction via push buttons and switches.
